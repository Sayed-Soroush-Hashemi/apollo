# apollo
a simple terminal-based music player

## 1. What the heck is this?
Are you in love with Terminal? Do you hate GUIs? Do you usually get drawn in oceans of tools and options arranged in the most confusing ways? Do you hate searching for what you need in designed-to-confuse menus? Come, brothers and sisters. Join me and enjoy this terminal-based music player. 

## 2. How to use?
There are only 6 commands. 3 for controlling the player, and 3 for manipulating your playlist. 

1. `apollo player play`: plays your playlist's tracks for eternity
2. `apollo player stop`: stops the player, i.e. kill the process
3. `apollo player next`: plays next track
4. `apollo playlist add <track_path>`: adds the track(s) you asked for to your playlist. This command accepts wildcards. For example you can use it like this: `apollo playlist add path/to/music/dir/*.mp3`
5. `apollo playlist clear`: clears the playlist
6. `apollo playlist edit`: open the playlist file in nano. Don't forget to save after your editing. 

## 3. What are the requirements?
only ffmpeg

## 4. How does it work?
It saves your playlist in a file named `playlist.txt`. When it's playing a track . . .

Alright. Alright. Enough. I submit to hunger. It seems I can't ignore it anymore. I feel I'm getting a headache as well. I'll complete this readme later. Now I need to eat something. A watermelon sounds delicious. Have good days, funny moments, and perfect music.
